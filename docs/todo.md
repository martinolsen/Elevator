TODO
====

* Elevator is currently being tweaked to be more generically usable
  and as a result is not yet fully operational.  There are various
  errors to correct and the API may be changing somewhat.
* Elevator needs tests showing SQL, NoSQL, and memcache in action.
* Move into MooseX:: namespace
* Package for CPAN
* More NoSQL drivers, all additions welcome
* Memcache frontage for NoSQL, if it makes sense?
* Clean up metaprogramming in BaseObject to make find_all/find be more intuitive
* More end user documentation
